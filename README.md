Make example of pull request and two branch merge event.
Rebase
Try to rebase feature branch with master branch
Change commit message
Commit push on commit in feature branch and then change commit message

Below commands are used by me:
1. Pull and Merge difference
For merge
              git merge feature
              
              or
              
              git merge --no-ff feature
2. Rebase
              git rebase master 
3. Change commit message
              git commit --amend -m <commit message> 
4. cherry pick
              git cherry-pick <ref number>
